The project aims to create a platform where users can put up ideas for innovative novel products in front of other users. 

These ideas are available for review and if a person feels an idea has potential for growth, they can contribute a small amount to that idea or contact the innovator directly if they wish to make bigger investments. 

This platform would help drive innovation and would be a huge boost to the numerous ideas that are never able to make it to the markets.

This marketplace, and all the transactions taking place here will be protected by the additional security provided by the decentralized validation methods through blockchain technology.
